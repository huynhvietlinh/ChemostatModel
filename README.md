            + Plot for different ration K_C/K_M
            + Plot the Herbert model
            + Plot the extended model
            + Plot the model with Hill function for the glycerol consumption (72 hours only)
      15 files in the folder "Data"
            + 3 file for different values of K_C
            + 4 data files of the Herbert model
            + 4 data files of the extended model
            + 4 data files of the Hill function
